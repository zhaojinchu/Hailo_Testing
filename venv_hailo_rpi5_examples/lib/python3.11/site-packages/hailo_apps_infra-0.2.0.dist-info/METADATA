# Hailo Applications Infrastructure

This repository provides the core infrastructure and pipelines required to run Hailo application examples.
It is built to be used on multiple platforms, including Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and x86_64 and aarch64 Ubuntu machines.
It includes ready-made pipelines for running detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation examples. It includes common building block and utilities:
- Gstreamer Application class
- Gstreamer pipeline helper functions
- Post processing scripts
- Hailo HEF file loader

The infrastructure is aimed to provide tools for developers who want to create their own custom pipelines and applications. It can be 'pip installed' as a dependency in your own projects.
See more information in our [Development Guide](./doc/development_guide.md).

For more general information and support visit the [Hailo Official Website](https://hailo.ai/) and [Hailo Community Forum](https://community.hailo.ai/).

## Hailo examples code structure
`hailo-app-infra` is used as a dependency in other Hailo examples repositories. The following diagram shows the code structure of the Hailo examples repositories:
![hailo_examples_code_structure](doc/images/hailo_examples_code_structure.svg)

## Hailo Requirements
This repo requires Hailo's tools to be installed.
All the required packages can be found in [Hailo developer Zone SW downloads](https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/software-downloads/)
For Raspberry Pi users we have it all integrated in Raspberry Pi OS and apt server. See [Raspbery Pi installation Guide](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples/blob/main/doc/install-raspberry-pi5.md) on `hailo-rpi5-examples` repo for more information.

Required packages:
- HailoRT driver (deb package)
- HailoRT (deb package)
- HailoRT Python API (whl package)
- TAPPAS (Installer) or tappas-core (deb package)
- TAPPAS Python API (whl package)

## Using the Repository as a Pip Package
-----------------------------
To install the package, ensure you are inside a virtual environment with Hailo requirements installed. Then, run the following command:
```shell script
pip install git+https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra.git
```
This will install the Hailo Applications Infrastructure package directly from the repository.

## Working Locally
To make changes and work with the code locally you can clone the repository and install it in editable mode:
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-apps-infra.git
pip install --force-reinstall -v -e .
```
`--force-reinstall` is required to reinstall the package if it was already installed. By the hailo-rpi5-examples repository, for example. As part of the installation flow.

## Running the Pipelines
--------------------
The pipelines should be be imported and wrapped with your own application logic.
See examples in [Hailo RPi5 examples repo](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo-rpi5-examples/blob/main/README.md)
